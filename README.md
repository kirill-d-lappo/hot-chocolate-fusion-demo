# HotChocolate Fusion Demo

## General

Basic setup with Hot Chocolate GraphQL library and Fusion.

Based on
original [quick-start](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate-examples/tree/master/fusion/initial/quick-start)
solution, but with some improvements:

* graphql schema regen at build
* fusion schema regen at build
* set up to use with Aspire
